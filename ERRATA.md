Errata for "Pinpointing Changes with Bisection"
===============================================

v1.0, 23rd German Perl/Raku Workshop 2021
-----------------------------------------

- During the demo from Slide 14, "Example 4: List Constant Inlining", some
  of the `perlbrew` output did not get recorded correctly by `asciinema`.
  (Also, in `talk_gpw2021.mp3`, I think I talked a little too fast
  during parts of this slide.)
